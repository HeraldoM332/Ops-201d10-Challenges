# Ops-201d10-Challenges
A collection of all tasks assigned in Ops 201d10


An overview of 201:

1. This repo is an overview of all the submitted challenges that I have come to learn in 201 using bash and powershell.

2. I am learning all these skills to attain a higher understanding of the Cybersecurity industry and to understand how multiple commands work and what they do

3. A fundamental concept that I learned to take into account was variables. I just admired the flexibility of it.

4. My favorite ops challenge was, in all seriousness the first one. "Hello, world" was the introduction to something bigger, like opening your eyes for the first time.

5. I feel like everything I have learned thus far will be essential in the workplace. It might be simple when it's understood, but all of it is vital.

6. If there was anything I wish to build upon it would be the loops script and I do intend to work more on it in the future. 

7. I would improve my loops skillset, specifically the while loop. I believe right now this is my weakest spot.
